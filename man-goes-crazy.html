    <div class="article">
      <p>In an event that some are calling "unprecedented" and others are calling "completely made up," a local man reportedly went completely insane after claiming to have uncovered the secrets of the universe while staring too long at a lava lamp.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses say the man, who wishes to remain anonymous but is known locally as “That Guy With the Beard,” began shouting mathematical equations in a language no one could understand. He then declared that “everything is triangles” before attempting to levitate using only positive thinking and hummus.</p>
      <p>“He kept pointing at clouds and whispering, ‘They’re watching again,’” said one neighbor. “Frankly, it was a little weird even for him.” Authorities arrived on the scene but were unable to determine whether he had actually discovered anything or just eaten too many expired edibles.</p>
      <p>Experts remain skeptical. “The secrets of the universe are unlikely to be uncovered during a backyard barbecue,” said Dr. Elaine Morris of the Canadian Rational Society. “But hey, stranger things have happened. I guess.”</p>
      <p>The man is currently resting comfortably in a hammock, allegedly communicating with other dimensions through interpretive dance.</p>
