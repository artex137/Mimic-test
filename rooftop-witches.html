        It started with one man. One sleepless, paranoid man convinced that witches had returned, not to the forests, but to the flat, tarpaper rooftops of suburban Toronto. He claimed they carried brooms — not Swiffers — and that they glowed faintly under the moonlight, mumbling hexes into the skyline. He also claimed his cat was communicating with them telepathically. Yes, really.
      </p>

      <p>
        Naturally, the man was dismissed by neighbors and anyone with a healthy attachment to reality. But that didn’t stop him from documenting his supposed sightings. Blurry photos, pixelated video, and one highly questionable recording of what he says is "witch cackling" (actually a raccoon mating call, experts suggest) are now making the rounds online.

        “They hover at dusk,” the man told reporters while adjusting an aluminum-foil scarf he claimed disrupted "broom frequencies." He insists they’re not local women either — “They don’t go to No Frills. They don’t vote. They just appear.” His theories have, unsurprisingly, drawn attention from both paranormal enthusiasts and Toronto city councillors, the latter mostly concerned about rooftop trespassing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Police say there is no evidence of supernatural activity but did advise residents to "secure loose objects" and "stop filming your neighbors in the dark." As for the man? He’s reportedly doubling down. “Laugh now,” he warned, “but you’ll be the ones sweeping up the ashes.”
