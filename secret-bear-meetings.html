      <p>In a story sure to rattle campers and picnic-goers alike, wildlife observers claim to have caught glimpses of grizzly bears engaged in what appear to be clandestine strategy sessions deep in the Canadian wilderness.</p>
      <p>“They weren’t just lounging around,” said one hiker. “One was clearly using a stick to draw diagrams in the dirt, and another was nodding like he understood. It was... unsettling.”</p>
      <p>The phenomenon has sparked speculation ranging from bear unions to interspecies parliament. Officials at Parks Canada refused to confirm or deny whether the bears were plotting against humans, stating only, “They have their own lives, man.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists have taken to social media to connect the sightings to salmon shortages, honey price inflation, and several missing backpacks.</p>
      <p>As always, experts advise keeping a safe distance from wildlife, especially if they appear to be holding executive board meetings in mossy dens.</p>
